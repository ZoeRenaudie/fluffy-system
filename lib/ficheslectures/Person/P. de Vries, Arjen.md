## Research

The main topics of my research include structured document retrieval and entity ranking, multimedia information retrieval, the application of information retrieval theory to recommendation systems and social media, nearest neighbour search in high dimensional spaces, the integration of information retrieval and database technology, and the evaluation methodology needed in these novel information retrieval application areas. My interests match the introduction of the _dataspaces_ abstraction, although that idea never reached the impact on CS research that it should have had.
