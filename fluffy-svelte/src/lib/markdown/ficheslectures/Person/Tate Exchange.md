## Biographie
Tate Exchange was founded in 2016 and works with the public to explore what happens when art and society meet. Working on a yearly themed programme of events, Tate Exchange is led by Cara Courage.  Reshaping the Collectible: When Artworks Live in the Museum (2018–2021) was a Tate research project that sought to interrogate forms of art and art making that challenge the practices and definitions of the museum and its collections. Information about the project and the team can be found here: www.tate.org.uk/ research/reshaping-the-collectible
